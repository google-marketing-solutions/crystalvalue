# Inputs for the GA4 feature extraction.
#
# Contents of this file will be used to generate the SQL script for feature
# extraction. The generated script can then be used as is or can be modified
# to extract additional features.
#
# There are 4 high level attributes:
#   event_name:
#     A list of event names. A bool column will be generated for each
#     event_name. These can then be aggregated to get features like number of
#     events of a particular type in lookback window.
#   event_params:
#     A mapping of event_name to a list of event_param names. For each event_name
#     and event_param, this will create a column by extracting the event_param
#     from rows that correspond to the event_name. Will only look at string_value
#     column in GA4 table for now.
#   user_properties:
#     A list of user_property names. Will only look at string_value column in GA4
#     table for now.
#   other:
#     A list of other non-repeated fields
