-- Build training dataset for a machine learning model to predict LTV.

-- The query creates a column `predefined_split_column` which takes approximately the
-- values `TEST` for 15% of customers, `VALIDATE` for 15% of customers and
-- `TRAIN` for 70% of customers. Note that there can be multiple rows for each customer (i.e.
-- customers are observed during different time windows). Time windows are defined by customers and
-- months, so a customer can be observed each month (with different features and future values).
-- There is at most 10 rows per customer in the final dataset (randomly sampled months) which
-- prevents frequent purchasers from having too much weight.

-- @param days_lookback INT The number of days to look back to create features.
-- @param days_lookahead INT The number of days to look ahead to predict LTV.
-- @param customer_id_column STRING The column containing the customer ID.
-- @param date_column STRING The column containing the transaction date.
-- @param value_column STRING The column containing the value column.
-- @param features_sql STRING The SQL for the features and transformations.
