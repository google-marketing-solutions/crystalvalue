## Overview

Crystalvalue is a best practice comprehensive framework for running end-to-end
LTV solutions leveraging Cloud AutoML. It provides best in class templates to
support data scientists in building and iteratively improving their LTV models,
enabling them to turn around LTV projects at pace.

## Problem statement

LTV is one of the most common marketing use-cases we support clients on. While 
we have plenty of resources on the topic e.g. code, part solutions
and presentations, there is no single comprehensive framework which covers
all the component parts of an LTV project. As a result, data scientists often
start from scratch and end up delivering solutions that do not follow best 
practice and in many cases do not create impact as they are not activated.
